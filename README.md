# Introduction
If there is one hobby that I have recently developed, it would have to be automating some of the most tedious yet important parts of my life using the little knowledge I have about computer programming. This first post is the first of a series of projects I intend to undertake in order to improve my own life. The hope I have for myself is through this process, I should be able to improve my computer programming skills through the projects, my writing skills through blog writing, and allow me more time to focus on important tasks that can not be automated. 

Although some of the skills listed on this series can be useful in a professional setting, I want to take a more intimate journaling approach to this series, as it's just more fun than writing in a super-dry 'corporate talk' that can take the fun and joy out of my writing. If you are looking for a more formal portfolio, please check out my Portfolio section! For everybody else (if there is anybody else), whether you are an prospective employer, co-worker, or just someone who is curious about my work, I hope you have as much fun reading this as I do writing.
