If there is one hobby that I have recently developed, it would have to be automating some of the most tedious yet important parts of my life using the little knowledge I have about computer programming. This first post is the first of a series of projects I intend to undertake in order to improve my own life. The hope I have for myself is through this process, I should be able to improve my computer programming skills through the projects, my writing skills through blog writing, and allow me more time to focus on important tasks that can not be automated. 

Although some of the skills listed on this series can be useful in a professional setting, I want to take a more intimate journaling approach to this series, as it's just more fun than writing in a super-dry 'corporate talk' that can take the fun and joy out of my writing. If you are looking for a more formal portfolio, please check out my Portfolio section! For everybody else (if there is anybody else), whether you are an prospective employer, co-worker, or just someone who is curious about my work, I hope you have as much fun reading this as I do writing.



Let me introduce you to a guy I know, the guy in the photo above. This photo was taken a hundred days into his military service in Korea. Don't let the happy-go-lucky expression on his deadpan face fool you, this guy was actually recovering from all the head shaving, being yelled at in his estranged mother tongue, crawling in mud, and shooting guns he had to endure for the last 100 days. Here's a fun fact though. At this time, this guy had no coding experience. Sure, he knew how to do some basic econometric analysis with Excel and was beginning to learn how to use the R programming language, but I want to be 100% upfront with you: much of the things this guy learned was through a mixture of self-teaching, 1 full year of rigorous academic training, and completing projects for either himself or his own employers. I'd say this guy can do some neat stuff with python now, but I'm not gonna be making you a mobile app anytime soon, I'm not gonna be hacking computers; I can't even guarantee I remember the difference between a bogosort and a bubblesort.
